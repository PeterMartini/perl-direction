=head1 Title

Add richer information to core warnings and errors

=head1 Problem Statement

There are a large number of warnings and errors in Perl 5, with a number
of new ones being added, old ones removed, or existing ones modified between
releases.  Currently, the only way to check against one error or another is
to do string matching, which is brittle and inefficient.

=head2 Sub-Problems

=over 4

=item Uniquely identify an error/warning

The error string may change, but as long as there is some component that
is stable and uniquely identifies the message, that part can be used for
future-proofing.

=item Provide a language-neutral reference

Error strings in Perl 5 are provided in English only; providing an alternate
key could make searches or translation easier.

=head2 Backwards Compatibility Constraints

Any solution chosen must fit the following set of constraints:

=over 4

=item No objectification

Any code which does not explicitly agree to seeing an object should always see
C<$@>, the argument in a C<$sig{__WARN__}> handler, etc, as a simple string
when it's being generated by the Perl 5 interpreter.

=head1 Possible Solutions

A number of mechanisms have been proposed and discussed, with summaries,
implementation options, and how those choices may constrain or complement
other initiatives listed below.  These are not necessarily mutually exclusive;
a solution could involve combining multiple options.

=head2 Add a header/trailer to each message

The simplest variant of this scheme is to add a unique number per message
to the start of the text of each warning or error, though the positioning
of the number and whether additional metadata (such as category) should
be added are points of stylistic debate.
